        <p>Modern high-voltage enthusiasts usually build Tesla coils similar to some of Tesla's "later" 2-coil air-core designs.
          These typically consist of a primary tank circuit, a series LC (inductance-capacitance) circuit composed of a high-voltage
           capacitor, spark gap and primary coil, and the secondary LC circuit, a series-resonant circuit consisting of the secondary
            coil plus a terminal capacitance or "top load". In Tesla's more advanced (magnifier) design, a third coil is added. The
            secondary LC circuit is composed of a tightly coupled air-core transformer secondary coil driving the bottom of a
            separate third coil helical resonator. Modern 2-coil systems use a single secondary coil. The top of the secondary is
             then connected to a topload terminal, which forms one 'plate' of a capacitor, the other 'plate' being the earth
             (or "ground"). The primary LC circuit is tuned so that it resonates at the same frequency as the secondary LC circuit.
             The primary and secondary coils are magnetically coupled, creating a dual-tuned resonant air-core transformer. Earlier
             oil-insulated Tesla coils needed large and long insulators at their high-voltage terminals to prevent discharge in air.
             Later Tesla coils spread their electric fields over larger distances to prevent high electrical stresses in the first
             place, thereby allowing operation in free air. Most modern Tesla coils also use toroid-shaped output terminals. These
             are often fabricated from spun metal or flexible aluminum ducting. The toroidal shape helps to control the high electrical
              field near the top of the secondary by directing sparks outward and away from the primary and secondary windings.</p>

        <p>A more complex version of a Tesla coil, termed a "magnifier" by Tesla, uses a more tightly coupled air-core resonance
          "driver" transformer (or "master oscillator") and a smaller, remotely located output coil (called the "extra coil" or
          simply the resonator) that has a large number of turns on a relatively small coil form. The bottom of the driver's
          secondary winding is connected to ground. The opposite end is connected to the bottom of the extra coil through an
          insulated conductor that is sometimes called the transmission line. Since the transmission line operates at relatively
          high RF voltages, it is typically made of 1" diameter metal tubing to reduce corona losses. Since the third coil is
          located some distance away from the driver, it is not magnetically coupled to it. RF energy is instead directly coupled
           from the output of the driver into the bottom of the third coil, causing it to "ring up" to very high voltages. The
            combination of the two-coil driver and third coil resonator adds another degree of freedom to the system, making tuning
             considerably more complex than that of a 2-coil system. The transient response for multiple resonance networks (of which
             the Tesla magnifier is a sub-set) has only recently been solved. It is now known that a variety of useful tuning
             "modes" are available, and in most operating modes the extra coil will ring at a different frequency than the master
             oscillator.</p>
