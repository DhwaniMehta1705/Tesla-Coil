        <p>Today, although small Tesla coils are used as leak detectors in scientific high vacuum
          systems and igniters in arc welders, their main use is entertainment and educational displays.</p>

        <p>Tesla coils are displayed as attractions at science museums and electronics fairs, and are used to
          demonstrate principles of high frequency electricity in science classes in schools and colleges.
          Since they are simple enough for an amateur to make, Tesla coils are a popular student science fair
          project, and are homemade by a large worldwide community of hobbyists. Builders of Tesla coils as a
          hobby are called "coilers". They attend "coiling" conventions where they display their home-made Tesla
          coils and other high voltage devices. Low-power Tesla coils are also sometimes used as a high-voltage
          source for Kirlian photography. The current world's largest Tesla coil is a 130,000-watt unit built by
          Greg Leyh and Eric Orr, part of a 38-foot-tall (12 m) sculpture titled Electrum owned by Alan Gibbs and
          currently residing in a private sculpture park at Kakanui Point near Auckland, New Zealand. Another
          very large Tesla coil, designed and built by Syd Klinge, is shown every year at the Coachella Valley Music
          and Arts Festival in Coachella, California. Tesla coils can also be used to generate sounds,
          including music, by modulating the system's effective "break rate" (i.e., the rate and duration of high power
          RF bursts) via MIDI data and a control unit. The actual MIDI data is interpreted by a microcontroller which
          \converts the MIDI data into a PWM output which can be sent to the Tesla coil via a fiber optic interface.An
          extensive outdoor musical concert has demonstrated using Tesla coils during the Engineering Open House (EOH)
          at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. The Icelandic artist Björk used a Tesla coil in her song
          "Thunderbolt" as the main instrument in the song. The musical group ArcAttack uses modulated Tesla coils and
          a man in a chain-link suit to play music.</p>

          <p id = "abc">Scientists working with high vacuum systems test for the presence of tiny pin holes in the apparatus
            (especially a newly blown piece of glassware) using high-voltage discharges produced by a small handheld Tesla
            coil. When the system is evacuated the high voltage electrode of the coil is played over the outside of the
            apparatus. At low pressures, air is more easily ionized and thus conducts electricity better than atmospheric
            pressure air. Therefore, the discharge travels through any pin hole immediately below it, producing a corona
            discharge inside the evacuated space which illuminates the hole, indicating points that need to be annealed or
            reblown before they can be used in an experiment.</p>
