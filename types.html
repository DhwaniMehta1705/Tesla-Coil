      <h1>1. Excitation</h1>
      <p>Tesla coil circuits can be classified by the type of "excitation" they use,
        what type of circuit is used to apply current to the primary winding of the resonant transformer:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Spark-excited</b> or <b>Spark Gap Tesla Coil (SGTC)</b>:
        This type uses a spark gap to close the primary circuit, exciting oscillations in the resonant transformer.
          Spark gaps have disadvantages due to the high primary currents they must handle. They produce a very loud noise
          while operating, noxious ozone gas, and high temperatures which may require a cooling system. The energy
          dissipated in the spark also reduces the Q factor and the output voltage. Tesla's coils were all spark-excited.</li>
          <br>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Static spark gap</b>: This is the most common type, which was described in detail in the previous section.
            It is used in most entertainment coils. An AC voltage from a high voltage supply transformer charges a
            capacitor, which discharges through the spark gap. The spark rate is not adjustable but is determined by
            the 50 or 60 Hz line frequency. Multiple sparks may occur on each half-cycle, so the pulses of output
            voltage may not be equally-spaced.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Static triggered spark gap</b>: Commercial and industrial circuits often apply a DC voltage from a power supply
            to charge the capacitor, and use high voltage pulses generated by an oscillator applied to a triggering
            electrode to trigger the spark. This allows control of the spark rate and exciting voltage. Commercial
            spark gaps are often enclosed in an insulating gas atmosphere such as sulfur hexafluoride, reducing the length
            and thus the energy loss in the spark.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Rotary spark gap</b>: These use a spark gap consisting of electrodes around the periphery of a wheel rotated at
            high speed by a motor, which create sparks when they pass by a stationary electrode. Tesla used this type
            on his big coils, and they are used today on large entertainment coils. The rapid separation speed of the
            electrodes quenches the spark quickly, allowing "first notch" quenching, making possible higher voltages.
            The wheel is usually driven by a synchronous motor, so the sparks are synchronized with the AC line frequency,
            the spark occurring at the same point on the AC waveform on each cycle, so the primary pulses are repeatable.</li>
          <br>
        </ul>

        <li><b>Switched</b> or <b>Solid State Tesla Coil (SSTC)</b>: These use power semiconductor devices, usually thyristors or transistors
          such as MOSFETs or IGBTs, triggered by a solid state oscillator circuit to switch pulses of voltage from a DC power
          supply through the primary winding. They provide pulsed excitation without the disadvantages of a spark gap: the
          loud noise, high temperatures, and poor efficiency. The voltage, frequency, and excitation waveform can be finely
          controllable. SSTCs are used in most commercial, industrial, and research applications as well as higher quality
          entertainment coils.</li>



        <ul>
          <br>
          <li><b>Single resonant solid state Tesla coil (SRSSTC)</b>: In this circuit the primary does not have a resonant capacitor
            and so is not a double-tuned circuit; only the secondary is. The current to the primary from the switching
            transistors excite resonance in the secondary tuned circuit. Single tuned SSTCs are simpler, but the resonant circuit
            has the total Q factor depends only on the secondary side resonant.</li>

          <br>

          <li><b>Dual Resonant Solid State Tesla Coil (DRSSTC)</b>: The circuit is similar to the double tuned spark excited circuit,
            except in place of the AC supply transformer (T) in the primary circuit a DC power supply charges the capacitor, and
            in place of the spark gap semiconductor switches complete the circuit between the capacitor and the primary coil.</li>

          <br>
          <li><b>Singing Tesla coil</b> or <b>musical Tesla coil</b>: This is not a separate type of excitation, but a modification to the solid
            state primary circuit to create a Tesla coil which can be played like a musical instrument, with its high voltage
            discharges reproducing simple musical tones. The drive voltage pulses applied to the primary are modulated at an audio
            rate by a solid state "interrupter" circuit, causing the arc discharge from the high voltage terminal to emit sounds.
            Only tones and simple chords have been produced so far; the coil cannot function as a loudspeaker, reproducing complex
            music or voice sounds. The sound output is controlled by a keyboard or MIDI file applied to the circuit through a MIDI
            interface. Two modulation techniques have been used: AM (amplitude modulation of the exciting voltage) and PFM
            (pulse-frequency modulation). These are mainly built as novelties for entertainment</li>

          <br>


        </ul>


        <li><b>Continuous wave</b>: In these the transformer is driven by a feedback oscillator, which applies a pulse of current to the
          primary winding each cycle of the RF current, exciting a continuous oscillation. The primary tuned circuit serves as
          the tank circuit of the oscillator, and the circuit resembles a radio transmitter. Unlike the previous circuits which
          generate a pulsed output, they generate a continuous sine wave output. Power vacuum tubes are often used as active devices
          instead of transistors because they are more robust and tolerant of overloads. In general, continuous excitation produces
          lower output voltages from a given input power than pulsed excitation.</li>




      </ul>



      <br>


      <h1>2. Number of coils</h1>
      <p>Tesla circuits can also be classified by how many resonant coils (inductors) they contain:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Two coil</b> or <b>double-resonant</b> circuits: Virtually all present Tesla coils use the two coil resonant transformer, consisting
          of a primary winding to which current pulses are applied, and a secondary winding that produces the high voltage, invented
          by Tesla in 1891. The term "Tesla coil" normally refers to these circuits.</li>
        <br>

        <li><b>Three coil</b>, <b>triple-resonant</b>, or <b>magnifier</b> circuits: These are circuits with three coils, based on Tesla's
          "magnifying transmitter" circuit which he began experimenting with sometime before 1898 and installed in his Colorado Springs lab
          1899–1900, and patented in
          1902. They consist of a two coil air-core step-up transformer similar to the Tesla transformer, with the secondary
          connected to a third coil not magnetically coupled to the others, called the "extra" or "resonator" coil, which is series-fed and
          resonates with its own capacitance. The output is taken from the free end of this coil. The presence of three energy-storing tank
          circuits gives this circuit more complicated resonant behavior. It is the subject of research, but has been used in few practical
          applications.</li>
